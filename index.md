#### Bibliography

Hi, Im Shreyas! I am a fourth year PhD student in Electrical Engineering working at [SCOPE Lab](https://scopelab.ai/index.html) in the “[Institute for Software Integrated Systems](https://www.isis.vanderbilt.edu/)” at [Vanderbilt University](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/), Nashville, Tennessee. I work for [DARPA's Assured Autonomy](https://www.darpa.mil/program/assured-autonomy) project and my research focus include Cyber-Physical Systems, Risk and Reliability, and Artificial Intelligence.
